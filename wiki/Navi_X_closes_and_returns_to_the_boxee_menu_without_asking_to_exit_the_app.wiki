Issue: Navi-X closes and returns to the boxee menu without asking to exit the app.

Explanation: At this time, there is currently no exit dialog function available in the Boxee API for python applications like Navi-X. When Team Boxee implements one, we will enable the feature. Until then, when you make it back to the home menu for Navi-X, if you press back, the app will automatically close and you will be returned to the Boxee menu.
