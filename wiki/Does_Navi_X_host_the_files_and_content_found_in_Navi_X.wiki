Issue: Does Navi-X host the files and content found in Navi-X?

Explanation: No. Navi-X only links to content on the internet, either by publically available channels or user-submitted links to content on the internet. We never host any multimedia content, thus content would not be available if a particular website was down or no longer serving such content from their website.
