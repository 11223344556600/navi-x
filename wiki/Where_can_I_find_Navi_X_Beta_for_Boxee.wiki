Issue: Where can I find Navi-X Beta for Boxee?

Explanation: Navi-X Beta for Boxee has been renamed to Navi-X Remix, as the app has been shelved by Team Navi-X for future developments. It was originally developed by a programmer known as Bartsidee. He is no longer actively developing the application and since we do not have a dedicated developer for active work on the version that was slated to be version 4.0 of Navi-X, the app has been shelved and moved to a new repository. 

To Fix This Issue: You can add the new Navi-X Remix repository by adding this address in your Boxee software under Apps > Repositories.
